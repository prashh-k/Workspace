Ah, I understand the question better now! You’re asking why the two objects (person1 and person2) have the same custom hash code (from your overridden hashCode() method) but still show the same @218b3819 in the toString() output when the toString() method is not overridden. Let me break it down:

Key Concepts

1. Custom hashCode():- You've overridden the hashCode() method in your Person class. The hash code of both person1 and person2 is calculated based on their data fields (name and age).

- Since the name and age fields for person1 and person2 are the same, the custom hash code is also identical. This is why:

Hash code of person1: 562771993
Hash code of person2: 562771993


2. Default toString() Behavior:- When you print the objects (System.out.println(person1)), Java calls the default toString() method from the Object class because you haven’t overridden it in your Person class.

- The default implementation of toString() 
    outputs:ClassName@MemoryAddressHashCode

- Here, the MemoryAddressHashCode is the hash code generated by the JVM for the object, which is based on the memory location of the object, not your overridden hashCode() method.


3. Why the Memory Hash Code Appears the Same:- 

-The @218b3819 you’re seeing in both person1 and person2 might make it seem like they are pointing to the same memory location, but this is misleading. 

-It often happens because the JVM's memory management can optimize and reuse memory for temporary outputs like the default toString().If the objects are short-lived, the printed memory-based hash codes can appear to match—even though the objects themselves reside at distinct locations in memory.



---Solution to Avoid Confusion---

If you want more meaningful and readable output when printing objects, you should override the toString() method in your Person class. For example:

@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + "}";
}


When this is done, printing person1 and person2 will output their data fields instead of the memory-based hash code, e.g.:

Person{name='John Doe', age=30}
Person{name='John Doe', age=30}

Summary
The key points are:
- Your overridden hashCode() method determines logical equality, e.g., for hash-based collections (HashSet, HashMap), but it does not influence the default toString() output.
- The toString() method from Object uses a memory-based hash that can sometimes appear the same for short-lived objects due to JVM optimizations.
- Overriding the toString() method in your class provides a readable, meaningful representation of the object.
