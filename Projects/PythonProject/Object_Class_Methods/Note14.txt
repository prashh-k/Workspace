Ah, I understand the question better now! Youâ€™re asking why the two objects (person1 and person2) have the same custom hash code (from your overridden hashCode() method) but still show the same @218b3819 in the toString() output when the toString() method is not overridden. Let me break it down:

Key Concepts

ðŸ”¹ 1. Custom __hash__() in Python
In Python, just like Javaâ€™s hashCode(), you can override the __hash__() method to define how an object should be hashedâ€”especially useful when using objects in sets or as dictionary keys.

def __hash__(self):
    return hash((self.name, self.age))

This ensures that two Person objects with the same name and age will have the same hash value.


ðŸ”¹ 2. Default __str__() Behavior in Python
If you donâ€™t override __str__() or __repr__(), printing an object will show something like:

<Person object at 0x7f8b2c3d1d30>


This is similar to Javaâ€™s default toString() output:
ClassName@MemoryAddressHashCode

Itâ€™s not based on your custom __hash__()â€”itâ€™s just the memory address of the object.



ðŸ”¹ 3. Why Two Objects Can Have the Same Hash but Different Memory Addresses
In Python:

---person1 = Person("John Doe", 30)
person2 = Person("John Doe", 30)

print(hash(person1))  # Same hash
print(hash(person2))  # Same hash
print(person1 is person2)  # False (different memory locations)

Even though the hash values are the same (because of __hash__()), the objects are still different in memory. Thatâ€™s why their default printed representations (if __str__() is not overridden) will show different memory addresses.


âœ… Solution: Override __str__() for Readable Output
To avoid confusion and make your object printouts meaningful:

def __str__(self):
    return f"Person(name='{self.name}', age={self.age})"
print(person1)
print(person2)

Will output:

Person(name='John Doe', age=30)
Person(name='John Doe', age=30)
